                  <p class="u-text u-text-3">Cloud computing is the term used to describe the enabling of various
computing resources to be conveniently utilised over the internet. These
computing resources involve the use of services, servers, storage, networks and
applications that can be rapidly accessed and allow the user to scale the
amount of computing resources to their current and future needs. &nbsp;</p>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-4"> Cloud computing utilises virtualisation which is the process
of allowing multiple users to share a single computer (the server) – which
fundamentally consists of a processor, memory, storage and network capacity --
at the same time without affecting each other; this contrasts to a single
person using a single piece of hardware such as a laptop. Virtualisation is
possible through software, called a hypervisor, which is loaded onto the server
and allows multiple instances of an operating system to be run at the same time
(Arabnia, Deligiannidis
&amp; Tinetti 2019, pg. 3). The importance of sharing a single piece of
hardware is that often the amount of computing resources, such as processing
power and storage, required are less than what the user needs which results in inefficient
use of hardware and power consumption (Ruparelia, NB 2016, pg. 1).</p>
                  <img src="images/virtualisation.png" alt="" class="u-image u-image-default u-image-1" data-image-width="768" data-image-height="295">
                  <p class="u-text u-text-5">Although it is possible to setup a private network that utilises
virtualisation to reduce power and hardware inefficiencies, there are still
many remaining issues such as managing hardware, security, and data. Providers
of cloud computing, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), offer to manage these
issues and provide benefits which include applications and rapid access to
these computing resources depending on user needs (Amazon Web Services 2021,
Benefits of cloud computing). This allows the user to have limited upfront
costs of purchasing hardware, hiring staff to manage it, whilst also allowing
for flexibility in the amount of resources needed in the future.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-6">Fox &amp; Hao (2017, p. 477-478) describes the three
main methods that cloud computing services offer as Infrastructure as a Service
(IaaS), Platform as a service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). These
services are often called a stack because they start from a more basic service
(IaaS) and increase to a more complex service (SaaS). IaaS is the most basic
and offers hardware infrastructure which provides computing resources such as
processing power, memory, storage and network capability. When choosing PaaS,
in addition to what IaaS offers, the user will also be provided with necessary
infrastructure such as operating systems and databases. Finally, in addition to
what both IaaS and PaaS provide, SaaS will provide the entire package with the
addition of software and application hosting. A popular example of SaaS use is
Google workspace, Dropbox, and salesforce.</p>

                  <h4 class="u-text u-text-8">What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be
done now?&nbsp;</h4>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-9">Current
cloud technology allows the user to purchase only the computing resources
needed. This scalability is a major feature of the cloud and improvements
through machine learning also allow the services to predict and change the
computing resources required by the user. An example of this service is Amazon
EC2 which recently released an auto scaling warm pools feature that allows
applications to start faster and stop processes sooner allows you to increase
and decrease the resources within only a few minutes (Amazon Web Services 2021,
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling introduces Warm Pools to accelerate scale out while
saving money). </p>
                  <h4 class="u-text u-text-10">What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3
years)?&nbsp;</h4>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-11">One of the expanding technologies relating to cloud computing is fog
computing which is expected to increase in usage over the coming years. This
technology deploys computing resources (edge devices), such as mobile base
stations, closer to the data sources to improve response times and network
latency (Buyya et al. 2019, p. 3). This responsiveness allows users to operate
and offload their high bandwidth applications and computational tasks, such as
virtual reality and security, with lower performance issues than connecting
directly to the main cloud server.</p>
                  <h4 class="u-text u-text-12">What technological or other developments make this possible?</h4>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-13">With edge devices offering reduces latency and response times, it is
desirable to cater to increasing bandwidth usage by users. Users on mobile
devices will be able to take advantage of these cloud advancements with the
assistance of wireless technologies such as 5G which may leverage a thousand-fold
improvement over the previous generation (Ren et al. 2020, p.2).</p>
                  <h4 class="u-text u-text-14">What is the likey impact?</h4>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-15">The use of edge devices for their improvements to responsiveness
and bandwidth efficiencies is likely to impact everyone who uses the cloud. This
includes the individuals who use their phones for private uses, such as video
games, to larger organisations that utilise a great amount of bandwidth for
surveillance recordings.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-16">Individuals concerned with performance can benefit greatly from
edge devices used by the cloud. Buyya et al. (2019, p. 11-12) describes the
utilisation of edge device servers to take the burden of heavy processing
whilst providing improved latency and response times. Interacting with edge
devices through the fog computing concept, users of devices such as smartphones
and health tracking watches can utilise the energy-saving features of the cloud
whilst retaining their responsiveness.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-17">Larger organisations often use large amounts of bandwidth, but
also require more responsiveness than the main cloud server can provide. (Ren et al. (2020,
p.2) describes the bandwidth usage concern for an airport that deals
with thousands of surveillance cameras and the accumulating data that results
from their recordings. With the use of edge devices such as dedicated smaller
servers located near the data source (the airport) it is possible for these
edge devices to filter through the video recordings before uploading them on to
the main cloud servers. This filtering process allows for the reduction of
otherwise large files to be more efficiency transmitted to the main cloud
server.&nbsp;</p>

                  <h4 class="u-text u-text-1">Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or
technologies?</h4>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-2">With the growth of the cloud and it being used as a substitute for
storage and computation of localised devices, it will reduce the pressure of
technology manufacturers of devices, such as smartphones and laptops, to expand
the capabilities of them. Although advancements in these devices are desirable,
especially the power consumption of smartphones, the increase in offloading of
these demands onto the cloud may result the redundancy of large local storage
capacity or other previously desired features.</p>
                  <h4 class="u-text u-text-3">How will this affect you?</h4>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-4">With the cloud being present in so many parts of daily life it is
difficult not to be affected. Daily I use products of the cloud such as online
banking, Emails, media streaming services, and gaming. With the continuous expansion
of edge computing servers, it will allow me to enjoy these services with less
response time issues. This is especially important for online gaming for which
response times and latency impact the activity significantly.</p>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-5">As someone who frequently uses devices in power saving modes, the increase
in low latency cloud services through edge devices will allow me to use my
smartphone with less worries of battery life. With the offloading of computing
processes to the cloud I will be able to worry less about my phone’s battery
draining and being stuck in important situations that require its use.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-6">In addition to less power consumption worries, I no longer need to
be as concerned with my smartphone having limited storage capacity. Previously
if more storage was required, I would often have to purchase additional
storage, but now cloud services often offer free storage.</p>

                  <p class="u-text u-text-8">Although as a user I most likely will not notice a significant
decrease using cloud and edge computing, it is certainly easy to appreciate
reduced annoyance from high response times of older cloud technologies. As I
continue down the path of utilising more technology as a software developer, I
am sure the daily benefits of cloud computing will become more appealing.</p>
                  <h4 class="u-text u-text-9">How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</h4>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-10">Much of my family and friends have already enjoyed the benefits of
cloud computing through its backup capabilities. Recently my family lost a lot
of localised data relating to videos and pictures but were fortunate enough to
have uploaded copies of this information to the cloud. Without the use of the cloud,
they would not have been able to restore the data and nostalgic pictures would
be lost forever.&nbsp;</p>

does it do?</h4>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-3">Autonomous
vehicles are an emerging technology that completely automates the driving
element of the vehicle using complex AI technology. Autonomous vehicles are
capable of sensing the environment around them and navigating their way through
said environments safely with little to no human influence.</p>
                  <h4 class="u-text u-text-4">Technology</h4>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-5">Autonomous
vehicles use a combination of old and new technologies such as Radar, Sonar,
Lidar, GPS, IMU (inertial measurements units) and odometry to operate a fully
driverless vehicle. All these technologies help to identify appropriate
navigation paths alongside identify relevant road signage and obstacles such as
civilians and structures.&nbsp;
Today
we are seeing a definite future with autonomous vehicles as more and more
companies are funding more and more research to develop driverless vehicles
such as Tesla, Uber and Navya. Which have all put out semi-autonomous vehicles.
Tesla has said it will offer a “subscription-based full self-driving” to
vehicle owners in 2021. The technology now to develop driverless vehicle is
rapidly advancing into a reality, so far Tesla has created an Autonomous
vehicle which was under the name “Tesla Autopilot” in 2015. Tesla rolled out a
version 7 update in the US which concluded Autopilot capability. Later in 2016
version 7.1 emerged adding a new feature that allowed to summon cars or
self-park at parking locations. This feature is still being used today but
required the full attention of the driver as the Tesla Autopilot will
occasionally fail to detect lane markings and disengage itself. In regards to
the Tesla Autopilot, it is almost certain that we will see fully automated
vehicles in the distant future. With companies such as Tesla reducing human
activity with certain driving elements is certainly a step closer to achieving
a fully automated vehicle.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-6">However,
there have been reports regarding Tesla’s reliability in terms of the
“Autopilot feature” as on the 20th January 2016 the first fatal crash occurred
whilst under the “Autopilot feature” where the driver wasn’t paying attention
to their surroundings and this is one of those incidents where the autopilot
failed to identify the road markings and crashed the vehicle. There have been
multiple occasions where the Tesla vehicle has crashed and even killing a
passenger. The technology used in these vehicles needs further refinement over
the years to truly be autonomous without any human support.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-7">Today
technological advancements in autonomous vehicles today have been mostly used
consistently with long-distance truck drivers which have a feature called
“cruise control” which maintains the speed and has sensors to indicate the
driver if you are in danger of a collision using sensors. These procedures half
automate the long-distance control over the vehicle. If technology keeps
advancing at this rate by 2030 one in every 10 cars will be fully automated
globally.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

automated vehicles, such as taxi companies e.g Uber, Didi, infinite cab, taxicabs,
13 cabs. Taxi drivers will be made redundant cutting the job entirely. A lot of
workers will have lost their jobs in the transportation industry due to
vehicles being automated. Trains have already started and are on the typing
point of being fully automated. For example, the Sydney metro in Australia is
one of the first fully automated vehicles. The Sydney Metro is completely
automated with no human interaction. And has proven to be a success with the
daily transportation between each stop. This has eradicated the workforce for
the metro line as they do not require staff on board which has reduced jobs in

the transportation industry. It will create a number of new ones and create a
demand for existing jobs such as “engineers” this will greatly help the economy
with the job loss.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The technology used in vehicles today will not be lost but merely
transformed and elevated to a higher standard. With the introduction of
autonomous vehicles comes more software being placed into the vehicles. And where
the next generation vehicles we are seeing a high rise in electric cars instead
of the diesel/petrol cars. This is extremely environmentally friendly and
eradicates greenhouse gasses and other pollutants, which will greatly help our
environment. Furthermore, several governments around the world have been
pleased with this new idea and have eradicated carbon emission in various
cities e.g “London city” which is helping the environment. Technologies such as
the “combustion engine” will soon become obsolete as the “induction motor” will
replace it proving to be less complicated, heavy and more efficient than the
standard” combustion engine”.</p>

How will this affect you?</h4>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-3">This will be a drastic change for me as having control over your driving
was a natural thing but if technology reaches the point of autonomous vehicles
it would definitely be strange being in the driver’s seat but not being able to
drive. The trains, trucks and other vehicles wouldn’t personally affect me too
much as it rarely concerns me in my way of life but it would definitely take
time for me and my family to get used to not being behind the wheel. </p>
